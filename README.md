# EquiMInds: Equity Market Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

EquiMInds is a Python-based data analysis project focused on scraping, processing, and visualizing equity market data from the Indian stock market. The project collects detailed financial metrics of the top 500 companies listed on the Indian stock exchange using web scraping techniques, followed by data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to provide insights into market trends and company performance.

This project is implemented as a Jupyter notebook (`EquiMInds.ipynb`) and leverages popular Python libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Why This Project?

The stock market is a complex and dynamic system where investors and analysts rely heavily on financial data to make informed decisions. However, accessing and processing this data can be challenging due to its volume and scattered nature.

This project aims to:

- Automate the extraction of up-to-date financial data for a large set of companies.
- Provide a clean, structured dataset for analysis.
- Enable exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to uncover patterns and trends.
- Serve as a learning tool for web scraping, data manipulation, and visualization in Python.
- Facilitate further financial modeling or machine learning projects using the curated dataset.

## Terminologies Used in the Project

Understanding the financial and technical terms used in the dataset and analysis is crucial:

- **CMP (Current Market Price)**: The latest trading price of a company's stock.
- **P/E (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)**: A valuation ratio calculated by dividing the current share price by earnings per share (EPS). It indicates how much investors are willing to pay per unit of earnings.
- **Market Cap (Market Capitalization)**: Total market value of a company's outstanding shares, expressed in crores (Rs.Cr).
- **Dividend Yield (%)**: The dividend income expressed as a percentage of the current share price.
- **NP Qtr (Net Profit for the Quarter)**: The profit earned by the company in the latest quarter.
- **Qtr Profit Var (%)**: The percentage variation in net profit compared to the previous quarter.
- **Sales Qtr (Sales for the Quarter)**: Total sales revenue in the latest quarter.
- **Qtr Sales Var (%)**: Percentage change in sales compared to the previous quarter.
- **ROCE (%) (Return on Capital Employed)**: A profitability ratio that measures how efficiently a company uses its capital to generate profits.
- **ROE (%) (Return on Equity)**: Measures the profitability relative to shareholders' equity over different time spans (3Yr, 5Yr, 7Yr).

## Project Structure and Workflow

### 1. Data Collection (Web Scraping)

- The project scrapes data from the website [Screener.in](https://www.screener.in/screens/355742/top-500-companies/) which lists top 500 companies with detailed financial metrics.
- It uses the `requests` library to fetch HTML content and `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract tabular data.
- Pagination is handled by iterating over multiple pages (1 to 20) to cover all 500 companies.
- HTTP headers are set to mimic a browser request to avoid blocking.

### 2. Data Processing

- Extracted rows from the HTML tables are cleaned and aligned with the column headers.
- Missing values in rows are handled by padding empty strings to maintain consistent column lengths.
- The data is converted into a `pandas` DataFrame for further analysis.

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization

- Statistical summaries (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation) are computed for key financial indicators.
- Visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots are generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to explore distributions and relationships.
- Insights into company performance, valuation, profitability, and growth trends are derived.
